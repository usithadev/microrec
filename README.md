# MicroRec

MicroRec is a simple screen recorder app made with electron.js

NOTE: you must have `ffmpeg.exe` in `assets` folder in order for the app to work correctly. You can download it from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases (remember to get the shared/standalone one. It will have a name similar to `ffmpeg-n6.1-latest-win64-gpl-shared-6.1.zip` or something.)
